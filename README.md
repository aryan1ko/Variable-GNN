# Learning Geometry on Fixed Topologies for Graph Neural Networks

A research project investigating how learning Riemannian metrics on fixed topological spaces compares to traditional fixed-geometry models in graph neural networks.

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt



todo: will add test_datasets and test_models to ensure modelc onsistentcy
need to finish run_simple_experiment
plot results for run_simple_experiment
plot training and validation curves
todo: plot comparison, generate total summary

todo: alter simple experiment to add more info abt overfitting and convergence speed.
